# FAQ: sitecheck

## What can I do with sitecheck?

The Python modules in `sitecheck` will run both as:

- library code for Python `import` into other modules; and
- stand-alone command line utilities that will process and analyze the HTML code in a web page.

## What are some examples of how I can use sitecheck?

I wrote this code to solve many of the problems that come up when developing websites. Some examples include:

- extracting the HTML in a specific `div` element so I can pull out just the content of a page that includes a header, footer and a sidebar.
- Extract meta information about a page, like the title or the time a page was created or updated.
- Write meta data extracted from an HTML to a JSON file.
- Remove specific HTML elements, like `img` or `noscript`
- List all the `divs` in an HTML document.
- List specific attributes in an html document.
