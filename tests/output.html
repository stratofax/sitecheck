Grab the reader with the first sentence.</p><p>2. Remove unnecessary words.</p><p>3. Keep things simple (write for a grade 8).</p><p>4. Short sentences are better.</p><p>5. Active voice is easier to process than passive.</p><cite>That’s <a href="https://twitter.com/farnamstreet/status/1155082453352157184">a Shane Parrish tweet</a> summarizing Scott Adams’ blog post, <a class="broken_link" href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html">The Day You Became A Better Writer</a> from The Dilbert Blog, so you know it’s good.</cite></blockquote><p></p><p> A few more writing tips to make your writing more compelling and accessible:</p><ul><li><strong>Write short paragraphs</strong> comprised of one or two short sentences. This breaks up the text, making it easier to read on screen.</li><li><strong>Avoid formal or jargon-laden language</strong>. Not everyone who comes to your site has a degree in the field. In fact, some people who visit your site may not even be experts! Don’t scare them off with dense language that only makes sense to insiders.</li><li><strong>Write like you’re explaining something to a friend</strong> in a casual conversation. You’re not going to say “therefore, in conclusion…” to someone in conversation, so don’t add that to your web pages, either.</li><li><strong>It’s better to be passionate and opinionated than “objective.”</strong> Let’s be honest, no one is truly objective. Unless you’re writing for a newspaper that insists on giving both sides of a story, <strong>make it clear where you stand and what you think.</strong> You’ll find this improves your writing, too.</li><li><strong>Be specific</strong>: good writing is concise and detailed. Avoid vague abstractions or broad generalizations. To help your reader understand, give an example.</li><li><strong>Stay focused on your main idea and topic:</strong> Each sentence on your page should explain one idea only, and each page should focus on one topic. If you want to express two separate ideas, use two separate sentences. If you want to explore more than one topic, write more than one post.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Layout for Web Pages</h2><p>The words you write matter, but so does the way you format them on the web page.</p><p>That’s because search engines like Google analyze your web pages to find clues about which words on your page are most important.</p><p>Google uses formatting as one of the factors in determining how relevant a word or phrase is to the content of your page.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Good page layout also improves readability &amp; SEO performace" class="wp-image-1442 lazyload" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-src="https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" data-srcset="https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-272x182.jpg 272w" decoding="async" height="683" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" width="1024"/><noscript><img alt="Good page layout also improves readability &amp; SEO performace" class="wp-image-1442" decoding="async" height="683" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" srcset="https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cadent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hal-gatewood-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-272x182.jpg 272w" width="1024"/></noscript><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@halgatewood">Hal Gatewood</a> on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, these text formats also make your web page easier to read:</p><ul><li><strong>Use lots of headings! </strong> Headings break up your text and tell a reader where to find the information they’re looking for in your page. Bonus SEO tip: incorporate keywords into your headings).</li><li>Use <strong>bold type</strong> to call attention to important words or phrases. Avoid <em>italics,</em> which can be difficult to read on a screen, especially for long passages of text.</li><li><strong>Use numbered and bulleted lists</strong>. Pro tip: highlight the important phrases in each list item to make the list even easier to scan (and easier for Google to analyze).</li><li><strong>Add graphics and photos </strong>with compelling, informative <strong>captions and alt text</strong>. Everyone loves to look at pictures. A well chosen image can draw attention to a section of your writing, and the image’s caption stands out from the rest of the text. Google thinks that words in captions and the image alt tag are extra relevant, too.
